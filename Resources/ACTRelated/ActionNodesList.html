        <h1>Action Nodes List</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>What is an Action Node?</h2>
            <div style="float:left">
                <p>Arguably one of, if not the most popular thing the modding community likes to mess with.</p>

                <p>In <strong>BULLY</strong>, just like many other games, characters (and even props) have a wide array of actions that can be performed.<br>
                Something that should be mentioned is that there's a difference between animations and actions.<br>
                The only properties that animations have are the playback speed and movement (walking, sprinting, strafing, etc).<br>
                On the other hand, actions are animations that can have multiple properties attached to them, such as sfx, vfx, etc.<br>
                A raw punch animation alone won't actually hit the opponent or produce noise.</p>

                <p>There are files using the <strong>.cat</strong> extension inside the <strong>Act.img</strong> archive, which can be speculated that means "Compiled/Compressed Action Tree".<br>
                The source version of these files uses the <strong>.act</strong> extension instead, which stands for "Action Tree".</p>

                <p>Action trees are usually used as a way to represent the various possible actions that a ped can perform depending on the situation.<br>
                These trees are made of action nodes, each one being a different action that a ped can do.<br>
                All trees start from a root node and, from there, it starts to "branch" into more action nodes until they meet an end (just like a real life tree, hence the name).</p>
                <p>Action nodes tend to have conditions on them as a way to know if the ped should or should not use that action at the moment.<br></p>

        <div><h2>First List Notes:</h2>
            <p>This first list has all the Action Nodes from the <a href="https://hiddenpalace.org/Bully:_Scholarship_Edition_(Debug_Build)" target="blank">Debug Wii Build</a>.
                As such, some might not work if you're trying to use them on a different platform. Check the second list for nodes which do not show up on Wii at all.<br>

        </div>

        <div><h2>Second List Notes:</h2>
            <p>This list of nodes are ones which are not present on the Wii version.
            Note that ones with <strong>LightAttacksWeapon</strong> and <strong>KnockOutChargeWeapon</strong> are exclusive to PC.<br>
