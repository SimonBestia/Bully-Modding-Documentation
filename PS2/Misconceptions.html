            <strong>Once again, I see a lot of people saying how things were cut from the game for many reasons:</strong>
            <figure class="quote" style="margin-left: 445px;">"There wasn't enough space on the DVD.”</figure>
            Not true. <strong>BULLY</strong> has a couple hundred Megabytes of free space.
            <figure class="quote" style="margin-left: 445px;">"The <strong>PS2</strong> wasn't powerful enough.”</figure>

            <figure class="quote" style="margin-left: 445px;">"Because of the <strong>T Rating</strong>."</figure>
            That rating is actually pretty flexible and <strong>BULLY</strong>'s cut content would probably not be enough to turn it to an <strong>M Rating</strong>.<br>

        <h3>What the developers have to say</h3>
        As you may already know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Games" target="blank">Rockstar Games</a> is a pretty
        secretive company.
        Every now and then, however, someone manages to contact developers, who can share stories.<br>This is what Andrew Wood had to say in regards to the 2nd floor of the Boys' Dorm:
        <figure class="quote">"When Bully started, it was an eight person
            Env team, by the third year in on production it was down to just myself and Jae Lee. Things needed to go."</figure>
