        <strong>Once again, I see a lot of people saying how things were cut from the game for many reasons:</strong>
        <blockquote class="quote">"There wasn't enough space on the DVD.”</blockquote class="quote">
        Not true. <strong>BULLY</strong> has a couple hundred Megabytes of free space. (Not to mention the scrapped content they could've deleted)
        <blockquote class="quote">"The <strong>PS2</strong> wasn't powerful enough.”</blockquote class="quote">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas" target="blank">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a>
        <blockquote class="quote">"Because of the <strong>T Rating</strong>."</blockquote class="quote">
        That rating is actually pretty flexible and <strong>BULLY</strong>'s cut content would probably not be enough to turn it to an <strong>M Rating</strong>.<br>
        <li>The Joker almost drops an F-bomb in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice:_Gods_Among_Us" target="blank">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a>.</li>
        <li>Realistic guns in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_(video_game)" target="blank">Shadow The Hedgehog</a> (and it's not even a <strong>T-Rated</strong> game).</li>
        <h2>What are the actual reasons for features being cut?</h2>

        <h3>What the developers have to say</h3>
        As you may already know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Games" target="blank">Rockstar Games</a> is a pretty
        secretive company.
        Every now and then, however, someone manages to contact developers, who can share stories.<br>This is what Andrew Wood had to say in regards to the 2nd floor of the Boys' Dorm:
        <blockquote class="quote">"When Bully started, it was an eight person
            Env team, by the third year in on production it was down to just myself and Jae Lee. Things needed to go."</blockquote class="quote">
